Cards is a simple programme that illustrates a few of go's simple structuers common to most programming languages such as if, if else, for loops and functions etc. More than this go provides some unique functionality that makes it a fun and flexible language. This includes the use of receivers, multi-type returns, multi-type declaration and assignment to variables, and type inference. 

the programme is comprised of the main file, a deck file in which we define the deck tyoe and its functions, and a text file. The test file is non-extensive but does highlight some boundary tests we may need in such a programme.
